### Testimonials

>Tinsae is great. While young, brought great depth of knowledge to Vanilla JS.
Has sound coding skills and structure. Also demonstrated excellent ability to
learn/adapt to new tech usually investing his own time to get up to speed
before starting a new assignment to ensure he is delivering great value. Had
some WP knowledge but did an excellent job in some custom plugin work
which he did not have past experience in. Hiring him again for other areas he
has been self educating on. A great long term and valuable asset for our
part-time needs in a variety of areas. Provides great value. Excellent English
skills. I highly recommend him.
